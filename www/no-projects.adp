  Before anyone can start working with the Logger application an administrator needs to setup a project.
</p>    
<if @admin_p@>
  <!-- User is an admin so offer him/her to map or create projects -->
  <p>    
    Since you are an administrator you may <a href="admin">visit the admin pages</a> to do so now.
  </p>
</if>
<else>
  <p>
    Please contact an administrator about this. Thank you.
